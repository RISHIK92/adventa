# **App Name**: Vertical Ascent

## Core Features:

- Subject Display & Animation: Displays subjects initially in a horizontal line, then animates the selected subject to the top center upon clicking.
- Lesson Display: Presents lessons as nodes connected by strings from left to right and top to bottom below the selected subject.
- Lesson Zoom & Options: Zooms into the selected lesson node to reveal 'Cheatsheet' and 'Formulasheet' options.
- Breadcrumbs-style Navigation: Provides navigation to the previous view, with clear visual affordance for a breadcrumbs style.
- Smart Suggestion Tool: Use an AI tool to suggest relevant, adjacent subject matter not present in the primary tree. Do not suggest information more than one level deeper in the tree than the current node.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Medium blue (#4681D4) for a calm and intellectual feel.
- Background color: Light blue (#E6F1FA) for a clean and uncluttered interface.
- Accent color: Soft violet (#A084CA) to indicate the currently active selection.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern look.
- Maintain vertical flow after subject selection, with lessons arranged cleanly, with generous negative space around elements to encourage focus.
- Incorporate smooth transitions when animating the subject and zooming into lessons for clear, non-jarring navigation.
