### Newton's Three Laws of Motion

1.  **First Law (Law of Inertia):** An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.
2.  **Second Law:** The acceleration of an object as produced by a net force is directly proportional to the magnitude of the net force, in the same direction as the net force, and inversely proportional to the mass of the object.
3.  **Third Law:** For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

### Key Concepts

-   **Mass (m):** A measure of inertia.
-   **Force (F):** A push or pull upon an object resulting from the object's interaction with another object.
-   **Momentum (p):** The product of an object's mass and velocity.
-   **Work (W):** The energy transferred to or from an object via the application of force along a displacement.
-   **Energy (E):** The capacity for doing work.
-   **Power (P):** The rate at which work is done or energy is transferred.
