# Electromagnetism

The study of the electromagnetic force, a type of physical interaction that occurs between electrically charged particles. This field is governed by a set of four equations developed by James Clerk Maxwell.

### Maxwell's Equations

1.  **Gauss's Law for Electricity:** `∇ ⋅ E = ρ/ε₀`
2.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** `∇ ⋅ B = 0`
3.  **Faraday's Law of Induction:** `∇ × E = -∂B/∂t`
4.  **Ampère-Maxwell Law:** `∇ × B = μ₀(J + ε₀∂E/∂t)`
