### Maxwell's Equations (Integral Form)

1.  **Gauss's Law for Electricity:** The net electric flux through any closed surface is proportional to the enclosed electric charge.
    $$ \\oint_S \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_0} $$
2.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** The net magnetic flux through any closed surface is zero (i.e., there are no magnetic monopoles).
    $$ \\oint_S \\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = 0 $$
3.  **Faraday's Law of Induction:** A changing magnetic field induces an electromotive force (and thus a current) in a closed loop.
    $$ \\oint_C \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = -\\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt} $$
4.  **Amp√®re-Maxwell Law:** Magnetic fields are generated by both electric currents and changing electric fields.
    $$ \\oint_C \\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = \\mu_0 I_{enc} + \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\frac{d\\Phi_E}{dt} $$

### Key Concepts
- **Electric Field (E):** The force per unit charge experienced by a small positive test charge.
- **Magnetic Field (B):** A field that exerts a force on moving charges and magnetic dipoles.
- **Lorentz Force:** The total force on a charged particle moving in electric and magnetic fields.
