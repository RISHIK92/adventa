# Calculus

The mathematical study of continuous change. It has two major branches, differential calculus and integral calculus.

### Key Concepts

-   **Limits:** The value that a function approaches as the input approaches some value.
-   **Derivatives:** The instantaneous rate of change of a function.
-   **Integrals:** The area under the curve of a function.

### Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

The theorem links the concepts of differentiating a function and integrating a function.

-   Part 1: `d/dx ∫[a,x] f(t)dt = f(x)`
-   Part 2: `∫[a,b] f(x)dx = F(b) - F(a)`
