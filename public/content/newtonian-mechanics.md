# Newtonian Mechanics

Classical mechanics as described by Sir Isaac Newton. It's based on three fundamental laws of motion.

### Newton's Three Laws

1.  **First Law (Inertia):** An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.
2.  **Second Law (F=ma):** The acceleration of an object is dependent upon two variables - the net force acting upon the object and the mass of the object.
3.  **Third Law (Action-Reaction):** For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

### Key Formulas

| Concept      | Formula         | Description                                  |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Force        | `F = m * a`     | Force equals mass times acceleration.        |
| Momentum     | `p = m * v`     | Momentum is mass times velocity.             |
| Work         | `W = F * d`     | Work is force applied over a distance.       |
| Kinetic Energy| `KE = 0.5 * m * v^2` | Energy of motion.                             |
